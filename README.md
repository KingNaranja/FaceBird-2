# What is FaceBird ?
*FaceBird 2* is single page web application that allows users to make posts and read other user's posts. 


### Client
This client is my remake of the collaborative [project](https://github.com/NeedsMoreCaramel/Facebird-Client) from my team from General Assembly. It is also my first React App!

My goal for this repo is learning as well as demonstrating some common web app functionality using 
React such as routing, registration and authentication.
